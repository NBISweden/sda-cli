SDA-CLI
=======

This is the Secure Data Archive (SDA) Command Line Interface (sda-cli). This
tool was created to unify and simplify the tools needed to perform the most
common user actions in the SDA.

This tool can be used to encrypt and upload data when submitting to the archive,
and to download and decrypt with retrieving data from the archive.

To get help on the usage of the tool, please use the `./sda-cli help` command.
